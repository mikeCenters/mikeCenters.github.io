**Family Law Tools**

Current Version: v: 1.5

*An app used to calculate child support payments and export Family Law Worksheets.*

The goal of this project is to provide users with clarity for informed decision making. Understand that there is no way in knowing how a judge will rule on a given case. The result of the calculations provided are determined based upon state provided formulas and obligation tables. While these formulas are used as standard practice, in some states a judge has final determination for what is to be ordered and used. The use of this app should be to gather information to seek further guidance and counsel. Always consult your legal counsel when making a legal decision.

**Features**
- Calculate Child Support payments with an annual, monthly, and bi-weekly format.
- Export state worksheets used to determine the calculation.
